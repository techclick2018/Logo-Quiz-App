# Logo-Quiz-App
30daysofkotlin Google bootcamp

I had developed a Logo Quiz Application using Kotlin.

It has following kotlin features:

arraylistof -> to store questions
nullability -> as the list of item will be null initially so it is declared as null
lateinit -> the keyword is used to late initialize the component at top of all functions but inside the class
dataclass -> to hold value Question class attribute
when statement -> used to get id of the selected option
